# odin-recipes

This is the assignment outlined on https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes

The objectives for this assignment are to create a web page with every aspect of html learned to date. This includes the boilerplate, headers, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, absolute and relative links, and embedded images.

The project also functions as a recipe hub! It won't be particularly pretty, but it will be functional. Thank you.
