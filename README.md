# odin-recipes

This is the assignment outlined on https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes

The objectives for this assignment are to create a web page with every aspect of html learned to date. This includes the boilerplate, headers <h1>, paragraphs <p>, ordered and unordered lists <ol> <ul> <li>, absolute and relative links <a href="link">, and embedded images <img src="link" alt="alternate text for no render">.

The project also functions as a recipe hub! It won't be particularly pretty, but it will be functional. Thank you.
